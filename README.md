# Ray-Tracing
Followed a tutorial on ray tracing, and added to it
Uses a camera to cast rays that interact with scene geometry, creating reflections and hard shadows

# What I learned
- 3D graphics using a camera with vectors
- Intersection geometry for planes and spheres
- How reflections work for 3 dimensional objects
- Anti-aliasing, and per-pixel sampling

> Point light, casting shadows to each sphere. Spheres also intersect plane to show clipping

> Fixed reflection problem, looks cleaner

I hope to add refractions, soft lighting, and in real time using rt cores in the future
